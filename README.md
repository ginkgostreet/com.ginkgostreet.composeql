# Compose-QL #

Composable SQL Queries.

CiviCRM extension providing an alternate DAO object for better SQL building.

Work in-progress. Goal is to allow for taking compose-QL query arrays and "composing" them.
Currently, composeWhere() is supported. Need to take a fresh-approach to composing JOIN clauses (and FROM).
